# Durable, Low Energy Bitcoin PoW

## DISCLAIMER

**DISCLAIMER: There exists no commercially available photonic miner as of today (Dec 18, 2021). PoWx mission is to implement dedicated hardware with smaller energy per hash as compared to conventional hardware. However, we do not have any guarantees about the hash rate or hardware price. As future hardware specifications might evolve, we reserve the right to adjust the proof-of-work algorithm in the future. Any possible algorithm adjustment will be publicly discussed well in advance.**

**Anyone trying to sell you a photonic miner is trying to scam you.**
